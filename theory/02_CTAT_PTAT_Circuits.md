# CTAT and PTAT Concepts in Bandgap References

## 1. Introduction

Bandgap references achieve temperature independence by combining two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients:

- CTAT (Complementary To Absolute Temperature)
- PTAT (Proportional To Absolute Temperature)

Understanding how these two components are generated is essential for designing a stable reference voltage.

## 2. CTAT Voltage Generation

The base-emitter voltage of a BJT decreases as temperature increases due to changes in carrier concentration and mobility. This behaviour produces a negative temperature coefficient.

The approximate relation is:

VBE​≈VG0​−αT

where V_BE reduces with increasing temperature (approximately −2 mV/°C).

In the implemented circuit, a diode-connected PNP transistor is used to generate the CTAT component.

### Key Observations from Simulation

- V_BE decreases linearly across temperature sweep.
- CTAT behaviour dominates at low scaling factors.
- Proper biasing is required to maintain exponential operation of the BJT.

## 3. PTAT Voltage Generation

PTAT voltage is created by forcing two BJTs with different emitter areas to operate at different current densities.

The voltage difference between the two BJTs is:

ΔVBE​=VT​ln(N)

where:

- VT = kT/q (thermal voltage)
- N = emitter area ratio

Since VT increases with temperature, ΔVBE becomes proportional to absolute temperature.

In this design, PTAT current is generated by placing a resistor across ΔVBE:

IPTAT = ΔVBE / R

This current is mirrored to generate the required bias currents.

### Key Observations from Simulation

- PTAT voltage increases almost linearly with temperature.
- Resistor value determines slope of PTAT current.
- Area ratio strongly influences overall scaling.

## 4. Combining CTAT and PTAT

The reference voltage is obtained by summing CTAT and scaled PTAT components:

VREF = VBE + k·ΔVBE

By selecting an appropriate scaling factor k (via resistor ratio), the positive and negative temperature coefficients cancel each other.

## 5. Practical Design Considerations

- Matching between BJTs is critical.
- Resistor accuracy directly affects temperature coefficient.
- Layout symmetry helps maintain PTAT linearity.
